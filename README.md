# APRIORI

- Apriori finds frequent itemsets (via support) and turns them into association rules (via confidence).
- These rules capture statistical relationships—i.e. correlations—but they do not prove that one item causes another.
    - What you don’t get: Causation. These rules do not tell you that “buying A causes buying B.” There could be hidden factors (e.g. promotions, seasonality, customer demographics) that drive both A and B together.
